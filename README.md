Howdy I'm WesTexFlatline!
I got my degree in psychology and have been teaching myself how to program and preform IT functions.
I'm still learning but would love to cut my teeth on some real world projects

Some of the fields i'm interested in are: AI, virtual and augmented reality, robotics (I actually have some experiance with this one), and security.
right now my knowledge is limeted to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a bit of Python.
